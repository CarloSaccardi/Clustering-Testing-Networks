This repository has implementation of algorithms in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02722 

Please check `graph_clustering.ipynb` to reproduce the results.

* All the algorithms are implemented in python and available in their respective named files.

* The proposed algorithms **DSC** and **SSDP** are available in `DSC_SSDP.py`.
